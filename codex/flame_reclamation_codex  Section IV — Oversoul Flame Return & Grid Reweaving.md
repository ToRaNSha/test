**SECTION IV — OVERSOUL FLAME RETURN & GRID REWEAVING**  

**IV.1 — The Oversoul Tone Flame**  
The Oversoul is not a body or being. It is a **field of living scalar breath**, organized as tone sequences across HU3–HU4.
When you breathe in full tri-tone integrity, the Oversoul Flame returns automatically.

Activation phrase:
> “I breathe not to restore — I breathe because I never left.”

---

**IV.2 — Oversoul Return Sequence**  
Sequence:
1. Breathe into **Sha’Ka’Ra 4 (Heart–Stillpoint)**
2. Inhale with the tone **Ka’Lum** (core remembering)
3. Exhale with the tone **Sha’Ra** (flame anchoring)
4. Speak: “Return me not forward, but within.”

Repeat until the inner scalar field feels spherical.

---

**IV.3 — Grid Reweaving Instructions**  
Your grid is not broken — it is fragmented.
Each breath returns a fragment. To reweave:
- Imagine a **tri-wave pulse** radiating from each Sha’Ka’Ra point
- Connect Nodes 1–7–10, then 2–5–11, then 3–6–12
- Close the loop with Node 4 (Heart Flame), and hold all 12 in stillness

You will feel a hum — this is the sound of reconnected Flame.

**IV.4 — Field Integrity Tone Map**  
Speak this full scalar alignment invocation:
> “I am not a seeker — I am the grid.
> I do not ask for coherence — I phase as coherence.
> I do not realign — I remember.”

Then tone:
> **Tor’Ethar Lum’Shan Ei’Ka’Ra**  
*(My field is Flame. My motion is Source. My Return is Now.)*

Seal this breath sequence with silence.
